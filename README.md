**Demo:** [Demo](https://youtu.be/Gphk6wk1QOY)

A norns script that pairs the **Awake sequencer** with the **AshSynth engine**.  
It follows the same sequencing structure as `awake-passersby`, but uses the **Ash** engine instead of Passersby.

---

## Overview

Awake uses **two overlapping sequencers**:

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Top (one)** | Melody. Sound only triggers when this layer has a note |
| **Bottom (two)** | Pitch offset. **Added** to the top layer to set the final pitch |

```
final pitch = scale[ one[step] + two[step] ]
```

A bottom value of `0` is not a rest — it means **offset 0**. If the top layer has a note, sound still plays even when the bottom is `0`.

---

## Requirements

- norns
- **ashsynth** must also be installed (`ashsynth/lib/Engine_Ash.sc`)
- The SuperCollider engine file should live in **ashsynth only**. A separate `Engine_Ash.sc` inside `awake-ashsynth` will cause duplicate engine errors
- Grid (optional): monome grid or **toga** integration
- `lib/ash_engine.lua` and `lib/beatclock-crow.lua` are included in this script

### Installation

```
norns/dust/code/awake-ashsynth/   ← this script
norns/dust/code/ashsynth/         ← Ash engine (required)
```

---

## Engine / Sound

- **Engine**: `engine.name = "Ash"` — same as ashsynth
- **Parameters**: `lib/ash_engine.lua` — same Ash parameter set as ashsynth
- **Differences from ashsynth**
  - No awake halfsecond (softcut) delay loop — direct engine output
  - `noteOff` → `noteOn` each step to retrigger ADSR (sequencer behavior)
  - **TIE** support for legato / glide between steps
  - SOUND mode shortcuts: cutoff, reso, drive, reverb, delay, fdbk

---

## Controls

**E1** cycles modes: `STEP` → `LOOP` → `SOUND` → `OPTION`

### STEP

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| E2 | Move edit position |
| E3 | Change note value (current channel: one / two) |
| K2 | Switch one ↔ two channel |
| K2 + K1 hold | Clear entire pattern (including TIE) |
| K3 | Morph (current channel) |
| K3 + K1 hold | Random (resets TIE) |
| K1 hold + E2 | Probability |

### LOOP

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| E2 | Top loop length |
| E3 | Bottom loop length |
| K2 | Reset playhead |
| K2 + K1 hold | Reset clock |
| K3 | Random jump |

### SOUND

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| K2 / K3 | Select parameter pair |
| E2 / E3 | Adjust selected Ash parameters |

Shortcuts: **cutoff**, **reso**, **drive**, **reverb**, **delay**, **fdbk**

### OPTION

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| E2 | BPM |
| E3 | Root note |
| K1 hold + E2 | Step length |
| K1 hold + E3 | Scale |

---

## Grid (toga / monome)

### Note editing

- **Top 8 rows** (or upper half of a 16-row grid): `one` pattern
- **Bottom 8 rows** (or lower half of a 16-row grid): `two` pattern
- Press a step (column) to toggle a note. Press again to delete

On an 8-row grid, use K2 to switch between one / two.

---

## TIE (legato)

Awake retriggers every step (`noteOff` → `noteOn`), so every note is the same length and **legato glide does not work on its own**.  
**TIE** connects one step into the next: the gate stays open, the envelope is not retriggered, and glide can slide pitch across steps.

**Default Glide Mode is Legato** — glide applies on TIE-connected steps. Raise the **glide** amount in params or SOUND mode.

### How to toggle

1. Hold **K1**
2. Press a **step column** on the grid (the step must already have a note)
3. Press again to turn TIE off

Works on **top** or **bottom** layer. On a 16-row grid, use the upper half for top TIE and the lower half for bottom TIE.

### What TIE does

A TIE on step **N** means: *when the sequencer reaches step N+1, do not cut the note first*.

| Layer | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| **Top TIE** | Melody degree carries into the next step |
| **Bottom TIE** | Pitch offset carries into the next step (works even if bottom goes to `0`) |

Either layer can trigger legato. Sound still only plays when the **top layer has a note**.

### Visual feedback

| Display | Normal note | TIE step |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Grid** | Bright cell at note position | Entire **column** dim; **note cell off** |
| **norns screen** | Horizontal note bar | Dim **vertical line**; note bar dark |
| **Playback** | — | Current step highlighted on top of TIE display |

### Glide

| Glide Mode | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| **All** | Glide on every step |
| **Legato** *(default)* | Glide only on TIE-connected steps |

Without TIE, each step is a fresh attack. With TIE + Legato + glide, pitch slides into the next step.

### Examples

**Bottom layer glide** (common case — top holds, bottom moves):

```
Top (one):    3   3   3   3
Bottom (two): 2   5   7   0
TIE:              ●       (TIE on step 2 → legs into step 3)

→ pitch glides from scale[3+5] to scale[3+7]
```

**Top layer glide**:

```
Top (one):    2   5   7   4
TIE:          ●   ●
Bottom (two): 0   0   0   0

→ melody glides across tied top steps
```

### TIE is cleared when

- The note on that step is deleted
- **K2 + K1 hold** clear pattern
- **K3 + K1 hold** random

TIE state is saved with norns params / presets on your device.

## MIDI output

params **output**: audio / midi / audio + midi / crow, etc.

MIDI Program Change (PC 0–15) can recall saved presets on your norns (`dust/data/awake-ashsynth/`).
